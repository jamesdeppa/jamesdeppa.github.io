  <h1>Goal and Rules</h1>
  <p <style >
    This guide aims to give directions to complete the Living Pokédex Challenge efficiently while still giving the player as much freedom as possible during their playthrough. The point is to allow people to play the game however they see fit and still be on track to complete the challenge smoothly once they reach the post-game. In order to be consistent, a few rules were thought of while writing the guide:

    The cartridge where all the Pokémon are stored is called 'main version' while the one that will be used for restarts is called 'side version.'

    Any Pokémon available via a Unique encounter on the main version is caught on said version, other Pokémon can be caught on any version.

    Catching a Pokémon is always preferred over getting it via in-game trade.

    Catching an evolved Pokémon is usually preferred over evolution via level up, but dependent on context.

    The main version is run glitchless, meaning the Mew glitch is performed on the side version.

    Guidelines

    Make sure the Pokémon you use in combat are ones whose evolution can only be attained via level-up. There are enough of them that you will most likely need to grind experience during cleanup anyway, so the earlier you start, the shorter the grind.

    While you are free do steps in a different order or try to catch a specific Pokémon early, know that any deviation may result in a longer playtime. That being said, adapting the guide to make up for lucky or unlucky captures in your game is highly encouraged. Feel free to use the Pokémon info page.

    You should always try and catch a Pokémon you don't already have if you encounter it.

    There is no point in trying to catch an unmentioned Pokémon until the cleanup, as you may encounter it naturally before then.

    The version specific steps are done on the 3rd playthrough of the side version and during the cleanup of the main version.

    Each area should be done in the order written in the guide, from top to bottom. The Pokémon in the areas are only ordered by encounter chance, and can be done in any order, though going for the rare Pokémon first is recommended.

    Checking a Pokémon as caught on this list automatically updates the Pokédex Tracker and vice-versa, except for when there are multiple options.

    For more tips and info (catching strategy, Mew glitch, Rare Candy locations...), check out the Extra info page.

    Enjoy yourself and have fun!
